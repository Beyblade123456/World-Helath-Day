       <h1> <b> Traditions of the day </b> </h1>

<p>     Since its inception, health issues and access to healthcare have been greatly campaigned for by people <br>
 all over the world on World Health Day. The World Health Organization has a different theme every year for <br>
 this day, which is highlighted in schools, seminars, workshops, and discussion forums. The day is all about <br>
  creating awareness for the health issues of the needy and the less fortunate in poor regions around the world, <br>
   as well as reminding us to be grateful for our health and to better take care of ourselves. <br>
   <br>
   <br>
Outdoor activities like hiking and bicycling are organized, as well as charity drives and <br>
 Mental health is often most neglected and, owing to our stressful lifestyles, it’s very important nowadays. <br>
  So mediation and therapy are greatly encouraged. Of course, you are what you eat, so the meals of the day <br>
   and restaurant promotions are all about maintaining a balanced diet. <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h1> <b>Air</b></h1>
         Our political, social and commercial decisions are driving the climate and health crisis. <br>
    Over 90% of people breathe unhealthy air resulting from burning of fossil fuels. <br>
    A heating world is seeing mosquitos spread diseases farther and faster than ever before. <br>
    Extreme weather events, land degradation and water scarcity are displacing people and affecting their health. <br>
    Pollution and plastics are found at the bottom of our deepest oceans, the highest mountains, <br>
    and have made their way into our food chain. Systems that produce highly processed, unhealthy foods and <br>
     beverages are driving a wave of obesity, increasing cancer and heart disease while generating a third of global <br>
      greenhouse gas emissions.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>World Health day History</h1>
     To talk about World Health Day, we need to talk about the creation of the World Health Organization as a <br>
 In December 1945, officials of Brazil and China proposed the creation of an international health organization,<br>
 that is all-encompassing and absolutely independent from any government powers.
 <br>
     Half a year later, in New York, in July 1946, the constitution of the World Health Organization was approved. <br>
Said constitution entered into force on April 7, 1948, as 61 countries signed in agreement for the inception
 of the NGO.
 <br>
As one of the first official acts of WHO, they created the celebration of World Health Day. <br>
 It was first observed on July 22, 1949, but the date was later changed to April 7, the establishment of WHO,
to encourage student participation. <br>
Since 1950, the Worth Health Day uses a different theme and theme each year selected by the current <br>
WHO Director-General, based on the suggestions of the member governments and staff.World Health Day provides <br>
a global opportunity to focus attention on important public health issues that affect the international community. <br>
On the occasion of World Health Day, promotional programs are launched that continue for a long time after April 7. <br>
World Health Day 2020 will shine a light on the vital role played by nurses and midwives in providing health care <br>
around the world, where advocacy events will be held around the world, including the launch of the first-ever <br>
State of the World’s Nursing Report, which will provide planning to optimize the contributions of the nursery <br>
 workforce, with a similar report on the Midwifery workforce to be done in 2021.
